Time
====

In principle, a _time_ is an infinitessimal instant in physical history.  A time
is independent of representation or time zone.  Two events are simultaneous if
and only if they occurred at the same time.

A time is infinitessimal; it has no duration.  In practice, a time is
represented by a finite-precision approximation, much as a real number is
approximated by a finite-precision floating point number.


Date
====

A _date_ is a social construct that represents a period of time of approximately
24 hours corresponding to one rotation of the Earth in a specific geographical
area.

A date is specific to time zone geography; for example, Monday, 2016 March 15 in
Tokyo starts and ends earlier than Monday, 2016 March 15 in New York.  The same
date in these two time zones overlaps only for a few hours.

A specific date in a specific time zone is generally, but not always, 24 hours
long.  For example, 2016 March 14 in the US/Eastern time zone is only 23 hours
long, as one hour was lost due to the transition from standard to daylight
savings time.


Daytime
=======

A _daytime_ (time of day) represents one of the instants within a given date.
For example, "noon" is a particular instant within some (unspecified) date.

Like a time, a daytime is infinitessimal, and is in practice is represented by a
finite-precision approximation.
